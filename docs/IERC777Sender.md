# [ðŸ”—](/interfaces/IERC777Sender.sol#L7) IERC777Sender
**Author** _Andrea Di Nenno_

This interface allows a token sender (EOA or Smart Contract) to add extra logic to control its outgoing tokens.


# Functions
## [ðŸ”—](/interfaces/IERC777Sender.sol#L16) `tokensToSend(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData)`

Called by an `ERC777` token contract before tokens are transferred or burned.

This call occurs before the contract state (i.e. balances) is updated and may revert to prevent transfer.

It is OPTIONAL both for a Smart Contract and an EOA to implement this interface.




### Parameters
* `operator` address of the operator, if any, that triggered the transfer
* `from` address of the token sender
* `to` address of the token receiver
* `amount` amount of tokens being sent
* `userData` extra information provided by the sender
* `operatorData` extra information provided by the operator, if present
